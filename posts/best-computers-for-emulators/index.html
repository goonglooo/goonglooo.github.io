Emulation has become increasingly popular for gamers who want to recreate the experience of playing older console games on modern hardware. With the right components, it is possible to achieve amazing emulation performance at 4K resolutions on platforms such as PSP, GameCube, Wii, Wii U, PS2, and even PS3. We will cover the specific parts needed for this build, as well as the step-by-step process of assembling the PC. Let’s dive in!\nThe Case: Height Revolt 3 The case chosen for this build is the Height Revolt 3, a sleek and stylish vertical case. The Height Revolt 3 is known for its clean aesthetics and compact design. It offers both form and function, making it perfect for this emulation-focused build. With the option to mount a three-slot GPU and ample space for cable management, the Height Revolt 3 is an excellent choice for this project.\nThe CPU: AMD Ryzen 5700G The CPU selected for this build is the AMD Ryzen 5700G. While the integrated graphics of the 5700G are not utilized in this build, the CPU itself offers powerful processing capabilities, which are crucial for running demanding emulators at 4K resolutions. The Ryzen 5700G features overclockable cores and provides more than enough CPU power for this emulation-focused PC.\nMemory and Motherboard Selection To complement the Ryzen 5700G, 16GB of DDR4 RAM running at 3200MHz is chosen.

The motherboard used in this build is the ASUS B550 Mini ITX, which provides the necessary features and connectivity options while maintaining a compact form factor.\nGraphics Card: Zotac RTX 3060 While the preferred choice for this build was the 1660 Super, the Zotac RTX 3060 is selected instead due to availability. The RTX 3060 is a powerful graphics card that is slightly overkill for emulator performance but offers excellent gaming potential on modern PC titles. When paired with a capable CPU, it provides exceptional graphical fidelity and smooth frame rates for both emulation and PC gaming.\nStorage: Inland NVMe SSD and 2TB HDD For storage, a 1TB Inland NVMe SSD is used as the primary drive to house the operating system. Its fast read and write speeds ensure that the PC boots up quickly and applications load in a snap. In addition, a 2TB HDD is included to store all game files and ROMs, providing ample storage for a vast library of games.\nBuilding the PC: Cable Management and Cooling Assembling the PC in the Height Revolt 3 case may require some attention to cable management due to its compact size. However, with careful planning, it is possible to achieve a clean and organized build. Proper cable routing not only improves aesthetics but also ensures excellent airflow, keeping the components cool for optimal performance.\nTo cool the Ryzen 5700G, a 240mm ID-Cooling AIO is chosen. This all-in-one liquid cooler has been tested in previous builds and proven to work well with the Ryzen 5700G, even when overclocked. The compact design of the Height Revolt 3 allows for the installation of this liquid cooler without compromising the overall build’s aesthetics.\nGPU Installation and Final Assembly The Height Revolt 3 case offers a unique design that eliminates the need for a riser cable when using a Mini ITX motherboard. The GPU is installed in the PCIe x16 slot, positioned to draw fresh air from the front and keep the CPU cool by drawing air over the radiator. The final assembly results in a stunning PC build that showcases the powerful components and meticulous cable management.\nEmulation Performance and Testing Once the PC build is complete, it is time to put it to the test. Alongside its main focus on emulation, the PC is also capable of running modern PC games. Testing games like Forza Horizon 5 and Doom Eternal at 1440p and 4K resolutions reveals impressive performance with smooth frame rates. The 5700G CPU and RTX 3060 GPU combination prove to be more than sufficient for gaming at high settings.\nMoving on to emulation, the PC excels in running PSP, PS2, Wii U, and even PS3 games at 4K resolutions. Titles like Midnight Club Dub Edition and Chains of Olympus for PSP run flawlessly at 10x resolution, showcasing the system’s capability to handle demanding emulators. The build also performs exceptionally well with GameCube, Wii U, 3DS, and original Xbox emulation, providing an immersive experience with upscaled resolutions.\nLastly, the RPCS3 emulator for PS3 performs admirably, allowing for smooth gameplay at 4K resolutions. Notable titles like God of War 3 and Persona 5 run well on this system, with the potential for future optimization to further enhance performance.\nConclusion In conclusion, the ultimate 4K emulation PC build combines powerful components to deliver outstanding performance in running older console games at higher resolutions. The Height Revolt 3 case provides an elegant and functional foundation for this build, while the AMD Ryzen 5700G CPU and Zotac RTX 3060 GPU offer the necessary power to achieve smooth gameplay. With proper cooling, cable management, and storage options, this PC build sets the stage for an immersive emulation experience. Whether you’re a fan of classic gaming or enjoy the latest PC titles, the ultimate 4K emulation PC offers a versatile and capable solution.\n","wordCount":"887","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Arnold Sanchez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://goonglooo.github.io/posts/best-computers-for-emulators/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Goonglooo","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://goonglooo.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Goonglooo (Alt + H)"><img src=https://goonglooo.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Goonglooo</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Best Computers for Emulators: Building the Ultimate 4K Emulation PC</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 23, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;887 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Arnold Sanchez</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-case-height-revolt-3>The Case: Height Revolt 3</a></li><li><a href=#the-cpu-amd-ryzen-5700g>The CPU: AMD Ryzen 5700G</a></li><li><a href=#memory-and-motherboard-selection>Memory and Motherboard Selection</a></li><li><a href=#graphics-card-zotac-rtx-3060>Graphics Card: Zotac RTX 3060</a></li><li><a href=#storage-inland-nvme-ssd-and-2tb-hdd>Storage: Inland NVMe SSD and 2TB HDD</a></li><li><a href=#building-the-pc-cable-management-and-cooling>Building the PC: Cable Management and Cooling</a></li><li><a href=#gpu-installation-and-final-assembly>GPU Installation and Final Assembly</a></li><li><a href=#emulation-performance-and-testing>Emulation Performance and Testing</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CK9ufLIRe-U style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>In this article, we will discuss the process of building the ultimate 4K emulation PC.
