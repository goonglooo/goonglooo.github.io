The ADC is responsible for dealing high amounts of damage and carrying the team to victory. In this article, we will explore the best ADC’s that can help you carry yourself to Masters in Smite. We will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each ADC and provide a tier list ranking for them.\nTier A ADC’s Apollo: Apollo is considered one of the best ADC’s to carry yourself to Masters. With his enhanced autos and global rotation ability, he has the potential to dominate the game.\nHachiman: Hachiman is a strong ADC but may not be as effective as Apollo in carrying the team to Masters.\nAnhur: Anhur is a versatile ADC who excels in self-peel and deals insane damage. He is a great choice to carry yourself to Masters.\nUllr: Ullr falls behind other ADC’s in terms of scaling and overall impact. He may not be the best choice for carrying yourself to Masters.\nTier B ADC’s Chernobog: While Chernobog has good lane pressure and damage, he lacks the ability to hyper carry and may struggle to carry you through Masters.\nSkadi: Skadi is decent but falls short in hyper carrying. Even with the buffs to items like Crusher and Heartseeker, she doesn’t have the potential to carry you to Masters.\nNeith: Neith has seen improvements with buffs to her abilities like her one and items like Heartseeker and Crusher. She is in a better position now and can be an effective ADC to carry yourself to Masters.\nArtemis: Artemis can carry but relies heavily on her team for protection. She requires a frontline to truly shine and may not be as self-sufficient as other ADC’s.\nTier C ADC’s AMC: AMC is easily gankable and lacks significant strength in the current meta. While the buffs to items like Crusher and Heartseeker may improve his performance, he is not considered a top-tier ADC for carrying yourself to Masters.\nCupid: Cupid’s effectiveness depends on the player’s skill and the value of his cripples. He can be decent but falls short in comparison to other ADC’s.\nFreya: Freya, on the other hand, is a powerhouse in the current meta. With her strong damage output, she can definitely carry you to Masters if played correctly.\nHou Yi: Hou Yi may not hyper carry like some other ADC’s but has good survivability and excels against diving opponents. He is considered a solid choice for carrying yourself to Masters.\nTier D ADC’s Izanami: Izanami is a bit one-dimensional and lacks the ability to make a significant impact in the game. While she provides guaranteed pressure, her weaknesses make her less effective in carrying yourself to Masters.\nChiron: Chiron has received buffs to items like Crusher and Heartseeker, improving his viability. He is a safe long-range hunter with good damage and can be a solid choice for carrying yourself to Masters.\nJing Wei: Jing Wei is a safe ADC with a strong late game. While she may not be as highly ranked as other ADC’s, she has the potential to carry you to Masters if played efficiently.\nTier F ADC’s Cherries: Cherries may have good survivability but lacks the ability to make a significant impact in the game. She is considered one of the weakest ADC’s and may not be an effective choice for carrying yourself to Masters.\nIshtar: Ishtar’s auto-attacks and limited abilities make her less effective in carrying you to Masters. She has fallen off in terms of strength and is not recommended for climbing the ranks.\nDanzaburou: Danzaburou has the potential to perform well in the game, but there are other ADC’s who outshine him in terms of carry potential. He is not as strong as some of the other ADC’s and may struggle to carry you to Masters.\nConclusion In conclusion, the ADC role in Smite is vital for carrying the team to victory. When aiming to climb the ranks to Masters, it’s important to select the right ADC that suits your playstyle and the current meta. From the analysis of the tier list, it is evident that ADC’s like Apollo, Hachiman, and Anhur excel in carrying themselves to Masters. However, other ADC’s like AMC, Cupid, and Jing Wei may require more skill and precise gameplay to achieve the same result. Choose your ADC wisely and work on improving your skills to become a formidable force on the battleground.\n","wordCount":"747","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Weaver"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://goonglooo.github.io/posts/smite-adc-tier-list/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Goonglooo","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://goonglooo.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Goonglooo (Alt + H)"><img src=https://goonglooo.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Goonglooo</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://goonglooo.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Best ADC's to Carry Yourself to Masters - Smite ADC Tier List</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 21, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;747 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Helen Weaver</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#tier-a-adcs>Tier A ADC&rsquo;s</a></li><li><a href=#tier-b-adcs>Tier B ADC&rsquo;s</a></li><li><a href=#tier-c-adcs>Tier C ADC&rsquo;s</a></li><li><a href=#tier-d-adcs>Tier D ADC&rsquo;s</a></li><li><a href=#tier-f-adcs>Tier F ADC&rsquo;s</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-gF4ElwfzGI style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In the game of Smite, the ADC (Attack Damage Carry) role plays a crucial part in the team&rsquo;s success.
