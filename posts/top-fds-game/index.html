This add-on for the Nintendo Famicom, or NES as it’s known outside of Japan, allowed gamers to play games on floppy disks instead of cartridges. The Famicom disk system opened up a whole new world of gaming experiences, and today we’re going to take a look at the 10 best games for this iconic system. These games are not only great for their gameplay and graphics, but they also don’t require knowledge of the Japanese language to enjoy. So whether you’re a Famicom disk system enthusiast or just getting started with retro gaming, these games are a must-play. Let’s dive in!\n1. False Aeon by Konami First up, we have False Aeon, a thrilling shoot-’em-up game by Konami. In this game, you take control of a spaceship and shoot enemies in circular waves as they approach the camera. While the music in False Aeon may not be the best Konami has produced, the gameplay itself is incredibly fun. Although it can be challenging at times to judge where you need to be to accurately shoot enemies, this game is sure to provide hours of pure enjoyment.\n2. The Mysterious Murasame Castle Next on our list is The Mysterious Murasame Castle, a game that could have easily been released in the United States during the NES era. This action-packed game features an overhead view similar to The Legend of Zelda, with plenty of exploration and power-ups to discover. The game’s setting, with its ancient Japanese castle, will remind players of the stunning visuals in Mario Odyssey. If you’re a fan of classic action-adventure games, The Mysterious Murasame Castle is a must-have!\n3. Ultraman: Hikari No Kyojin Densetsu If you’re a fan of the Ultraman TV show, you’ll love Ultraman: Hikari No Kyojin Densetsu. In this side-scrolling platformer, you play as the human character from the show and transform into Ultraman to fight off enemies. The goal is to find icons that power up your Ultraman meter, allowing you to unleash powerful kicks and punches. Along the way, you’ll encounter giant kaiju creatures that are easier to defeat in Ultraman form. This game is a blast to play and will satisfy both Ultraman and platforming fans.\n4. Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa Join a magical baby on an adventure in Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa, a colorful platformer by Konami. As the baby protagonist, you use a magic rattle to defeat enemies and help you navigate the levels. When you hit enemies with the rattle, they puff up like balloons, allowing you to jump on them or use them as projectiles. With its charming graphics and enjoyable gameplay, this Konami gem is a perfect addition to your Famicom disk system collection.\n5. Golf Force: Eternal Story If you’re a fan of vertical scrolling shooters, Golf Force: Eternal Story is a game that shouldn’t be missed. At first glance, it may seem generic, but this game has a unique twist. As you defeat bosses, you unlock new characters that add additional weapons to your ship. These “pods” give your ship extra hits, making it more resilient to enemy attacks. Maneuvering the pods strategically adds a layer of complexity and enhances the gameplay experience. Golf Force: Eternal Story is proof that even seemingly generic games can surprise you with their depth and innovation.\n6. Myke Tyson’s Super Punch Bear Next up, we have Myke Tyson’s Super Punch Bear, a quirky and fun game from Konami. This action-adventure game starts with a humorous opening cinematic, which sets the stage for the gameplay. You navigate through levels by jumping from invisible tile to invisible tile, reminiscent of the dungeons in Startropics. Armed with a weapon, you must explore and overcome challenges while searching for a missing girl. Myke Tyson’s Super Punch Bear is a nostalgic and entertaining game that will captivate both classic gamers and newcomers alike.\n7. Hermina’s Miracle Combine the thrill of Indiana Jones with the Gothic charm of Castlevania, and you get Hermina’s Miracle. In this side-scrolling platformer, you play as an archaeologist armed with a hookshot. You use the hookshot to ascend through levels by latching onto platforms above you. However, be prepared for challenging enemies and tricky platforming sections that will put your skills to the test. With its unique gameplay mechanics and fantastic artwork, Hermina’s Miracle is a standout title for the Famicom disk system.\n8. Toki Toki, also known as “Oh Toki,” is a musical shooter that adds a whole new twist to the vertical shmup genre. In this game, you control a character that shoots musical notes by pressing the A button and a direction on the D-pad. The notes you shoot coincide with the rhythm of the game’s music, creating a harmonious gameplay experience. Although it may sound unusual, Toki is incredibly fun once you get the hang of it. Don’t let its quirky premise fool you; this game is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered.\n9. Super Mario Bros. 2 No list of Famicom disk system games would be complete without Super Mario Bros. 2. Originally released in Japan as Doki Doki Panic, this game was rebranded as Super Mario Bros. 2 for the international market. Although it strays from the traditional Mario formula, Super Mario Bros. 2 is beloved for its unique characters, creative level design, and memorable soundtrack. If you’re a fan of the Mario franchise or platforming games in general, Super Mario Bros. 2 is a must-play.\n10. Akumajou Dracula Finally, we have Akumajou Dracula, the Japanese version of Castlevania. This iconic title is a side-scrolling action-platformer that follows the vampire hunter Simon Belmont. Armed with a whip and various sub-weapons, you venture through Dracula’s castle, battling hordes of monsters and experiencing thrilling boss fights. Akumajou Dracula is renowned for its challenging gameplay, atmospheric music, and memorable enemies. For fans of the Castlevania series or anyone looking for a classic, gothic adventure, Akumajou Dracula is an absolute must-have.\nConclusion There you have it – the 10 best Famicom disk system games that you should play.
